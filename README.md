# ICAP_controller
Include:
+ Interface: AXI-Stream
+ Asynchronous fifo which 2 different clocks.
+ ICAP_statemachine: which control the signal to hard core ICAP.

We are really thank to Kizheppatt Vipin and Suhaib A. Fahmy for their paper: "A high speed open source controller for FPGA Partial reconfiguration".
That really helps us a lots.

** We are on the testing state so we are not sure if it will run right :(
