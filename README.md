# ICAP_controller

Objectives:
+ First step: see how the ICAP works and how to make it works.
+ Second step: add to the hrav_framwork which do the virus scan.
+ Third step: ultilize the speed.

Include:
+ Interface: AXI-Stream
+ Asynchronous fifo which 2 different clocks.
+ ICAP_statemachine: which control the signal to hard core ICAP.

References: We are really thank to 
+ Sir. Kizheppatt Vipin and Sir. Suhaib A. Fahmy for their paper: "A high speed open source controller for FPGA Partial reconfiguration".
+ Sir. Clifford E. Cummings for his paper: "Simulation and synthesis techniques for Asynchronous FIFO Design".

That really help us a lots.

** We are on the testing state so we are not sure if it will run right :(
